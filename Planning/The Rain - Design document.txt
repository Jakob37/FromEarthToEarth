- You contain a limited amount of mud
- You can absorb mud blocks/tiles, refilling your mud
- You are constantly withered down by the rain
- The rain can have different strengths (degree of downpour)
- There is thunder
- You can be struck by thunder, annihilating you
- Thunder randomly strucks one of the highest points present at the map
- Trees are higher than you, and so are blocks
