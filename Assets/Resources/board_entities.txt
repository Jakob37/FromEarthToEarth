# Level 1
level1_1|You look lost
level1_1|Don't worry, I am lost too
level1_1|Most of us are, although some seem better at pretending!

level1_2|They say if you find the Elder she will give you your purpose
level1_2|I feel generally confused
level1_2|Does that mean I need to go to the Elder? It seems so far...

level1_3|I am so nervous!
level1_3|Today, I'll try to make my first mud block
level1_3|What if I fail in front of everyone?
level1_3|My parents will be there too. I would be so embarassed!

level1_4|To find the elder, you need to travel to the far east
level1_4|You need to find your path through a cave, to climb a mountain
level1_4|Seems like a lot of trouble! I think I rather stick around here

# Level 2
level2_1|I am earth. You are earth. Earth is earth.
level2_1|It is a funny thing.
level2_1|We are earth. Yet we are thinking, laughing, living.

level2_2|Are you also on your way to the Elder?
level2_2|Me too, but the road got blocked. Can you help us out?
level2_2|I don't know what to give you though

level2_3|You removed the blockage? You're the best!
level2_3|Or at least, top three best!

level2_4|Once upon a time, there were only mud and stones.
level2_4|Then something happened. Some of the mud - us - started living.
level2_4|This was confusing. What is the Purpose of being a mud blob?
level2_4|Noone really knows. Well, maybe except the Elder.

level2_griever|I lost my brother yesterday, right over there.
level2_griever|How should I tackle this? It feels like a thick clump in my stomache.
level2_griever|Hey, thanks for hearing me out. Sometimes having someone listening helps a lot.

# Level 3 - Cavern
level3_1|We got stuck here some time ago.
level3_1|First we panicked. Then we realized it is kind of cosy down here.
level3_1|Maybe we are fine without getting to the Elder? Are we?

level3_2|I want to stay here, but I am worried what people will say.
level3_2|Everyone else wants to get to the peak.
level3_2|Should I get up too? Should I want to get up?

level3_3|Some say the Big one was born here.
level3_3|Some say this cavern was created when he ascended to the peak.
level3_3|I say they are delusional, in need of further research!

level3_4|...
level3_4|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this I feel truly alive.

# Level 4 - Ascent
# Almost at the Elders place
# Thoughts about technology (levers)
# One blob got stuck on the way and started building all the levers, instead of searching for the Purpose
# Maybe Elder isn't extremely fond of visitors? Catch on good day.

level4_1|It is so high!
level4_1|Someone once said to me "No gain, by pain".
level4_1|Better stay down here. Some things are simply not worth the effort.

level4_2|For a long time it wasn't possible to climb this mountain.
level4_2|Then a bunch of us came together and decided to change that.
level4_2|After a year we had invented levers! Moving poles by the press of a button.
level4_2|It is amazing what we can accomplish if we work together!

level4_3|I am so angry. The mudblob over there destroyed my block!
level4_3|He simply pushed it out into the rain and ran away.
level4_3|Why would he do such a thing?
level4_3|I was so close getting up too. He is the worst.

level4_4|I wanted to borrow her block so that I could get up.
level4_4|But I was too slow and it was dissolved.
level4_4|Now she hates me and thinks I am the worst.
level4_4|And maybe I am :(

# Level 5 - The Elder

theelder|You found me too? You are one of those persistant ones.
theelder|You want a Purpose?
theelder|Searching for a Grand Quest. Wishing there should be a purpose for us.
theelder|That sounds like the most ambitious form of wishful thinking to me!
theelder|...
theelder|I can give you something better though. A Question.
theelder|Ask yourself, what feels purposeful?
theelder|When you find that, use it as guide.
theelder|Go figure out what feels purposeful to you.
theelder|In the long run we are all mud anyways.

theelder_activated|Move along now. You are the expert on you, not me. Figure out what feels purposeful.

# Level 6 - Downcast and without Purpose

# Level 9 - Satisfaction, the purpose is found


level2_s1|You see that block over there? It is made out of the same stuff as us. A temporary mud-blob.
level2_s1|I wonder. If we are made from the same stuff. What makes us so different? Are we different?
level2_s1|Thoughts like this are keeping me up each night.
level2_s2|Today is no ordinary day. Today, I will get to make my first own mud-block.
level2_s2|Mom will be so proud!
level2_s2|I am quite stressed out though. All those people. What happens if it isn't good enough?
level3_s1|Me and my husband has been stuck down here for ages! Is quite cozy and dry though.
level3_s1|It is a challenge to live so close together though. All those small things, they drive us both mad.
level3_s1|Thankfully, we are able to talk it through. Without that, we would both have gone insane by now.
level3_s2|Why should I be the one cleaning up all the mud in here? Just because I drag in a bit more?
level3_s2|*Grumble grumble*
level3_s3|...
level3_s3|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this, I truly feel alive.
level4_s1|Great job making it this far! I want to warn you though, this final level is quite a bit more tricky than previous.
level4_s1|No shame in giving in here. If you make it through though, make sure to let Jakob know. He will be impressed!
level_levers_s1|Ever seen one of these before? Press the button, and its poles will move.
level_levers_s1|Took decennia of effort to build and polish. It is amazing what we when working together over time.
level_levers_s1|What are you waiting for? Try it! You can either stand on it yourself, or place the block there.
level_levers_s2|It is so high! I wonder how to get up there.
level_levers_s2|Personally, I am terribly afraid of heights. I better stay down here. Forever.
level1_further_controls|Restart level with 'R'. Speed up block dissolving with 'P'.
