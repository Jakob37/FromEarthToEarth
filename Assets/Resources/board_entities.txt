intermission12|Hello you. How are you doing? Guess we are in this together.
intermission12|Like the weather? Like talking about the weather? No? Oh well, I'm doing my best.
intermission23|You know what? You seem nice! Good luck out there.
intermission23|Feet!
intermission34|I was rude back there, wasn't I? Sorry! I get a bit carried away sometimes.
intermission34|But you know what? We are made by the same stuff. Random stuff stuffed together for a brief time. Stuff coming, stuff going.
intermission45|Next question. We are made by the same stuff as the mud over there. What makes us different?
intermission45|We seem to have a strange ability to think, dream and worry unlike any mud-block I have seen. What's all that about?


# Level 1
lost1|You look lost
lost1|Don't worry, I am lost too
lost1|Most of us are, although some seem better at pretending!

lost2|They say if you find the Elder she will give you your purpose
lost2|I feel generally confused
lost2|Does that mean I need to go to the Elder? It seems so far...

lost3|To find the elder, you need to travel to the far east
lost3|You need to find your path through a cave, to climb a mountain
lost3|Sounds like a lot of work if you ask me

# Level 2
# Path blockage
# Mud-life history

ponderer1|I am earth. You are earth. Earth is earth.
ponderer1|It is a funny thing.
ponderer1|We are earth. Yet we are thinking, laughing, living.

ponderer2|Are you also on your way to the Elder?
ponderer2|Me too, but the road got blocked. Can you help us out?
ponderer2|I don't know what to give you though, more than eternal gratitude

blocked2|You removed the blockage? You're the best!
blocked2|Or at least, top three best!

ponderer3|Once upon a time, there were only mud and stones
ponderer3|Then something happened. Some of the mud - us - started existing more intently
ponderer3|This was of course confusing. What is the Purpose of being a mud blob?
ponderer3|Noone really knows. Well, maybe except the Elder

griever1|I lost my brother yesterday, right over there. He wasn't able to resist the rain any longer.
griever1|It is sad, but it is how it is around here. Everyone has to come to terms with this.
griever1|I'm trying to figure out how to tackle this. It feels like a thick ball in my stomache.
griever1|Hey, thanks for hearing me out. Sometimes just talking about it and having someone listening helps a lot.

# Level 3 - Caver
# A religious sense
# Turning to religion to find the Purpose, but that is up to them. Who can actually tell them they are wrong?


# Level 4 - Ascent
# Almost at the Elders place
# Thoughts about technology (levers)
# One blob got stuck on the way and started building all the levers, instead of searching for the Purpose
# Maybe Elder isn't extremely fond of visitors? Catch on good day.

# Level 5 - The Elder

theelder|You found me too? I isolated myself here to avoid visitors
theelder|It worked for a while, but the most persistant still manage to find me
theelder|A Purpose? That's what all of us are after. I still haven't found mine.
theelder|But I have been around for a long time through, so have some things to tell you about the question
theelder|I think it is wrongly phrased - it sounds like there should be some actual goal of being a blob of mud
theelder|That sounds like the most ambitous form of wishful thinking if you ask me
theelder|...
theelder|A better question? Yes, yes, I'll give you one.
theelder|"What can I do which feels purposeful?" I think that is a much more useful question.
theelder|It translates it from a black-or-white question to a graduality, more a matter of which direction to navigate than finding a certain point in the vast ocean
theelder|Also, I am allergic to black-or-white thinking. It is too convenient, and people trust their instincts too much.
theelder|So what feels purposeful to you you say? Aahh, how should I know?
theelder|What about exploring that yourself? Mudblobs hardly listen to advice anyways, we like to figure out things ourselves.
theelder|Shush now, move along. I have talked enough for a day or two now.
theelder|Go figure out what feels purposeful for you, or don't. In the long run we are only mud anyways.

theelder_activated|Move along now. You are the expert on you, not me. Figure out what feels purposeful.

# Level 6 - Downcast and without Purpose

# Level 9 - Satisfaction, the purpose is found


level2_s1|You see that block over there? It is made out of the same stuff as us. A temporary mud-blob.
level2_s1|I wonder. If we are made from the same stuff. What makes us so different? Are we different?
level2_s1|Thoughts like this are keeping me up each night.
level2_s2|Today is no ordinary day. Today, I will get to make my first own mud-block.
level2_s2|Mom will be so proud!
level2_s2|I am quite stressed out though. All those people. What happens if it isn't good enough?
level3_s1|Me and my husband has been stuck down here for ages! Is quite cozy and dry though.
level3_s1|It is a challenge to live so close together though. All those small things, they drive us both mad.
level3_s1|Thankfully, we are able to talk it through. Without that, we would both have gone insane by now.
level3_s2|Why should I be the one cleaning up all the mud in here? Just because I drag in a bit more?
level3_s2|*Grumble grumble*
level3_s3|...
level3_s3|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this, I truly feel alive.
level4_s1|Great job making it this far! I want to warn you though, this final level is quite a bit more tricky than previous.
level4_s1|No shame in giving in here. If you make it through though, make sure to let Jakob know. He will be impressed!
level_levers_s1|Ever seen one of these before? Press the button, and its poles will move.
level_levers_s1|Took decennia of effort to build and polish. It is amazing what we when working together over time.
level_levers_s1|What are you waiting for? Try it! You can either stand on it yourself, or place the block there.
level_levers_s2|It is so high! I wonder how to get up there.
level_levers_s2|Personally, I am terribly afraid of heights. I better stay down here. Forever.
level1_further_controls|Restart level with 'R'. Speed up block dissolving with 'P'.
