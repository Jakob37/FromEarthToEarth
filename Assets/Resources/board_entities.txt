## Sassy
level1_2|name|-
level1_2|Oh hi. New here? Guess you haven't found your Purpose yet? Thought so!
level1_2|You will get the hang of things. Or not. Whatever.

level1_2|I haven't found mine yet :(

## Nervous
level1_3|name|-
level1_3|I am so nervous! Today, I'll try to make my first mud block

level1_3|My parents will be there too. I would be so embarrassed!
level1_3|*shiver shiver*

## Lazy
level1_4|name|Lazy Bob
level1_4|To find the Elder, you need to travel to the far east
level1_4|And I mean far east. Too far for me!

level1_4|What kind of lunatic would put himself through that?

# The blockage

## Ponderer
level2_1|name|Pondering Pia
level2_1|I am earth. You are earth. Earth is earth.
level2_1|It is a funny thing.
level2_1|We are earth. Yet we are thinking, laughing, living.

## Panic
level2_2|name|-
level2_2|I don't know what to do! Are you also on your way to the Elder?
level2_2|Me too, but the road got blocked. We are stuck!
level2_2|I don't know what to do, what to do...

## Grateful, trying to be cool
level2_3|name|-
level2_3|You removed the blockage? You're my hero!
level2_3|Or, err, it was a chill thing you did there

## Confused ponderer
level2_4|name|-
level2_4|Once upon a time, they were only mud and stones.
level2_4|Then something happened. Some of the mud - us - started living.
level2_4|This was confusing. What is the Purpose of being a mud blob?

## Griever
level2_5|name|Grieving Gregory
level2_5|I lost my brother yesterday, right over there.
level2_5|He wasn't able to resist the rain any longer.
level2_5|How should I tackle this? It feels like a thick, sucking clump of sad in my stomach.
level2_5|Hey, thanks for hearing me out. Sometimes having someone listening helps a lot.

# The cavern

## Cynic / atheist
level3_1|name|-
level3_1|Some say the Big Mud Man was born here.

## Anxious about content
level3_2|name|Content Claire
level3_2|We got stuck here some time ago
level3_2|First we panicked. Nobody could stay down here, could they?

level3_2|Maybe we are fine without getting to the Elder? What do you think?

## Anxious about peoples thinking
level3_3|name|Considerate Conrad
level3_3|I want to stay here, but I am so worried what people will think
level3_3|Everyone else says they want to climb the peak
level3_3|I don't want to be different, so I say it too

level3_4|name|Mindful Mathias
level3_4|...
level3_4|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this I feel truly alive.

# The ascent

## Unmotivated
level4_1|name|-
level4_1|It is so high! It stretches to the skies!
level4_1|Someone once said to me "No gain, by pain"
level4_1|I don't want to climb it anymore, it can't possibly be worth the effort

## Curious about science
level4_2|name|Building Bob
level4_2|For a long time it wasn't possible to climb this mountain
level4_2|Then a bunch of us came together and decided to change that
level4_2|After a year we had invented moving poles!
level4_2|It is amazing what we can accomplish when we work together!

## Angry at blockdestroyer
level4_3|name|-
level4_3|I am so angry. The loose mud-blob over there destroyed my block!
level4_3|He simply pushed it out into the rain and ran away.
level4_3|I was so close to getting up too.
level4_3|Why would he do such a thing? He is the worst. I will tell all my friends about him!!

## Mortified blockdestroyer
level4_4|name|-
level4_4|I wanted to borrow her block so that I could get up
level4_4|But I was too slow and it was dissolved
level4_4|Now she hates me and think I am the worst
level4_4|Maybe I am too :(

# The Elder

theelder|name|The Elder
theelder|...
theelder|...
theelder|So, what is it you want from me?
theelder|...
theelder|Yes, yes, I know. You want me to figure out your purpose in this dreadful existence, don't you?
theelder|Thought so!
theelder|...
theelder|You really think it is that easy?
theelder|Alright, alright, I have some words for an overthinker such as yourself
theelder|It is good to think about things, but don't overdo it
theelder|It is good to share what's on your mind, but don't expect someone else to do the solving for you
theelder|Find ways to express yourself
theelder|Explore yourself, explore others
theelder|And really, really learn to listen
theelder|...
theelder|That's all. You will figure something out. I am sure of it.
theelder|Better make the best of it!
theelder|Sheesh now, move along
theelder|Let me overthink in peace

theelder_activated|Move along now. You are the expert on you, not me. Figure out what feels purposeful.

# Level 6 - Downcast and without Purpose

# Level 9 - Satisfaction, the purpose is found


level2_s1|You see that block over there? It is made out of the same stuff as us. A temporary mud-blob.
level2_s1|I wonder. If we are made from the same stuff. What makes us so different? Are we different?
level2_s1|Thoughts like this are keeping me up each night.
level2_s2|Today is no ordinary day. Today, I will get to make my first own mud-block.
level2_s2|Mom will be so proud!
level2_s2|I am quite stressed out though. All those people. What happens if it isn't good enough?
level3_s1|Me and my husband has been stuck down here for ages! Is quite cozy and dry though.
level3_s1|It is a challenge to live so close together though. All those small things, they drive us both mad.
level3_s1|Thankfully, we are able to talk it through. Without that, we would both have gone insane by now.
level3_s2|Why should I be the one cleaning up all the mud in here? Just because I drag in a bit more?
level3_s2|*Grumble grumble*
level3_s3|...
level3_s3|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this, I truly feel alive.
level4_s1|Great job making it this far! I want to warn you though, this final level is quite a bit more tricky than previous.
level4_s1|No shame in giving in here. If you make it through though, make sure to let Jakob know. He will be impressed!
level_levers_s1|Ever seen one of these before? Press the button, and its poles will move.
level_levers_s1|Took decennia of effort to build and polish. It is amazing what we when working together over time.
level_levers_s1|What are you waiting for? Try it! You can either stand on it yourself, or place the block there.
level_levers_s2|It is so high! I wonder how to get up there.
level_levers_s2|Personally, I am terribly afraid of heights. I better stay down here. Forever.
level1_further_controls|Restart level with 'R'. Speed up block dissolving with 'P'.
