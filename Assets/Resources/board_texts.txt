intermission12_1|Hello you. How are you doing? Guess we are in this together.
intermission12_2|Like the weather? Like talking about the weather? No? Oh well, I'm doing my best.
intermission23_1|You know what? You seem nice! Good luck out there.
intermission23_2|Feet!
intermission34_1|I was rude back there, wasn't I? Sorry! I get a bit carried away sometimes.
intermission34_2|But you know what? We are made by the same stuff. Random stuff stuffed together for a brief time. Stuff coming, stuff going.
intermission45_1|Next question. We are made by the same stuff as the mud over there. What makes us different?
intermission45_2|We seem to have a strange ability to think, dream and worry unlike any mud-block I have seen. What's all that about?
griever1_1|I lost my brother yesterday, right over there. He wasn't able to resist the rain any longer.
griever1_2|It is sad, but it is how it is around here. Everyone has to come to terms with this.
griever1_3|I'm trying to figure out how to tackle this. It feels like a thick clump in my stomache.
griever1_4|Hey, thanks for hearing me out. Sometimes just talking about it and having someone listening helps a lot.
level2_s1_1|You see that block over there? It is made out of the same stuff as us. A temporary mud-blob.
level2_s1_2|I wonder. If we are made from the same stuff. What makes us so different? Are we different?
level2_s1_3|Thoughts like this are keeping me up each night.
level2_s2_1|Today is no ordinary day. Today, I will get to make my first own mud-block.
level2_s2_2|Mom will be so proud!
level2_s2_3|I am quite stressed out though. All those people. What happens if it isn't good enough?
level3_s1_1|Me and my husband has been stuck down here for ages! Is quite cozy and dry though.
level3_s1_2|It is a challenge to live so close together though. All those small things, they drive us both mad.
level3_s1_3|Thankfully, we are able to talk it through. Without that, we would both have gone insane by now.
level3_s2_1|Why should I be the one cleaning up all the mud in here? Just because I drag in a bit more?
level3_s2_2|*Grumble grumble*
level3_s3_1|...
level3_s3_2|Do you feel the breeze? On days like this, I truly feel alive.
level4_s1_1|Great job making it this far! I want to warn you though, this final level is quite a bit more tricky than previous.
level4_s1_2|No shame in giving in here. If you make it through though, make sure to let Jakob know. He will be impressed!
level_levers_s1_1|Ever seen one of these before? Press the button, and its poles will move.
level_levers_s1_2|Took decennia of effort to build and polish. It is amazing what we when working together over time.
level_levers_s1_3|What are you waiting for? Try it! You can either stand on it yourself, or place the block there.
level_levers_s2_1|It is so high! I wonder how to get up there.
level_levers_s2_2|Personally, I am terribly afraid of heights. I better stay down here. Forever.
level1_further_controls|Restart level with 'R'. Speed up block dissolving with 'P'.
