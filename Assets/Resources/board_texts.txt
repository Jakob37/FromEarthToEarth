intermission12_1|Hello you. How are you doing? Guess we are in this together.
intermission12_2|Like the weather? Like talking about the weather? No? Oh well, I'm doing my best.

intermission34_1|I was rude back there, wasn't I? Sorry! I get a bit carried away sometimes.
intermission34_2|But you know what? We are made by the same stuff. Random stuff stuffed together for a brief time. Stuff coming, stuff going.

intermission45_2|We seem to have a strange ability to think, dream and worry unlike any mud-block I have seen. What's all that about?
griever1_1|I lost my brother yesterday, right over there. He was unable to resist the rain any longer.

griever1_3|Want an advice on listening?
griever1_4|Don't try to fix the problem. Listen. Let feelings be felt. Show that someone cares.
