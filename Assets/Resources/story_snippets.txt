# Level 1

- Idea: Climbing the mountain is kind of an education
- Idea: Kind of philosophical approach

You look lost
Don't worry, I am lost too
Most of us are, although some are better on putting on a show than others

I haven't found my purpose yet
I want to go to the Elder
They say you get Enlightened there
Although I have never met anyone who has actually talked to the Elder

You know, you'll only stick around for some time
Better hurry finding the Elder
They say you need to travel to the top of the mountain

I am content here and now
Why travel to the mountain? To the Elder?
I am fine as it is
No gain, from pain <- Can I use this?

I am earth. You are earth. Earth is earth.
It is a funny thing
We are earth
Yet we are thinking, laughing and living

You see these flowers? (Next to purple flower)
Some say they have special powers
I am not much for anecdotal evidence
But I think this has been confirmed by peer reviewed research

# Level 2

- Need minor issue on the way?
- Maybe road is blocked by blocks, and it needs to be cleared? Nice! Get the rain to it.
- Help others make their way to the elder too

I am trying to get to the Elder, but they say the road is blocked
We have worked all day to get through
Can you help us? The pile is at the end of this path

What do you think about this
There is an infinite number of bad things going on the world
But! There is also an infinite number of good things
Some think about the bad, some the good, some both
How do you choose to think about the world?

Some people get stressed when things don't go their way
Too many blocks to build, too many levers to move
I have to do things, but I also want to do things
So who is making me do things, me or the world?

# Level 3

- Cavern level - Holy cave?
- What is the setting here?

Once upon a time the first mud-person was shaped by the great mud-giant
After that he climbed through this mountain to the peak
This is when this cavern was created
Or so they say at least, I am an atheist
I can still appreciate the beauty and awesomeness of this cavern though

They say the Elder was born in this cave
They say the Giant was born in this cave
They say the Purpose was created in this cave

...
...
Oh giant Giant, can you tell me my Purpose?

The Giant spoke to me yesterday
He told me to tell everyone else to speak to him too
First when

# Level 4

- Maybe another blockage here, which can be resolved by working with levers - Leading rain down to it
