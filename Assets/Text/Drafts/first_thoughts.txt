Sometimes, I wonder, how it all came to be
What are we? Who are we?
But perhaps more importantly, why are we?

I came from earth
I am made from earth
My body, my self
But still I want to be more
Want to think that I am more
Than earth

It has rained for so, so long
I wither
My friends wither
I want to do what I can
But sometimes it is hard, to see a way

As I grew, I learned how to master this body
I learned that I could shape the world
Use it for my benefit
Destroy it on my whim

# To a block
You are also earth, but yet I claim to be more
Am I?

The rain came back, more intense than ever
It is hard to not wilt away, but so far I have managed
But some days are tough
It is hard to see why the days just keep passing

# Shaping a large pile of blocks to get to a height
Sometimes, I get an itch
An urge to create
To shape the world
I feel powerful, for a fleeting moment
I build something of beauty

# Meeting somebody
Today, something strange happened
Something out of this world

- Hi
- Hello
- I am lost. Can you help me?

- Thank you. What is your name? I am Bob.

One day he was gone. He almost seemed happy about it.
